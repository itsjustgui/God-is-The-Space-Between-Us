    <h2>The Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      There was this one song called <b>"God Is The Space Between Us"</b> and if you remember, I
      always wanted to make a video with it for us. I always found that title super interesting
      because we were doing long distance for a good part of our relationship, and that song always
      reminded me of you.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I chose to make that title the theme of this project, wich is more than adequate, given
      that distance is all we have left now. This project is composed of three main parts:

        <h3>The PhotoBook</h3>
        <p>
          A physical album that captures our story, from start to end. Each page was carefully
          crafted to display our timeline.

          The bridge that brings together the memories captured in the book, as well as the video

    <h2>The Work Put In</h2>
    <div class="insight-content">
      <p>
        It was quite time consuming to put all of this together. Many times I thought to myself:
        <i
          >"Gui, she already has a new man, and you are with someone else too, why do you keep
          workinig on this?"</i
        >
        But then I realized this was indeed the last step I needed to really move on, and allow the
        thought of you to be nothing but a good memories I spent with a special person at a time of
        my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozens of hours were spent refining everything, from the video editing to the image collage
        for the book.<br /><br />
        For the flowers, I had to take classes of crochet to learn how to follow the tutorial and
        make the flowers right (It was quite fun tho can't lie).<br /><br />
        The hardest and most time consuming was making this page. I wanted to make sure it looked
        pretty and that the center of it was <b>you</b>. Everything from the colors to the
        animations and design was carefully thought. Did you like the background of the app being
        some snippets of our moments? Pretty cool right?
