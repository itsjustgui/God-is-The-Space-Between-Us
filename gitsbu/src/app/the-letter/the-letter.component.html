        <p class="greeting">Dear Inês Cor de Rosa,</p>

        <p>
          Sorry that this took some time to get to you. I understand it might not have the same
          meaning as intended, but at the end of the day, this page is just a mark in time of the
          moments we shared in this life. Pleasse read it with an open heart and mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          We had a lot of ups and downs, sometimes more downs than ups, but our relationship was
          loving and had a lot of potential. There isn't much more to say that hasn't been said
          already, so I'll be brief:
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope that this milestone of your life has served you to learn more about yourself and
          about what you want for yourself in your life.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are one of the most caring women I've ever met. I cannot wish you anything but the
          very best for you in your life. I hope you remain an exemplary and reliable friend to
          those who count on you.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you become a faithful and dependable wife to the man whom you choose to have by
          your side, and that he respects and acknowledges your wants and needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you become a formidable mother of three kids who know they will always have someone
          that loves them.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I hope you get to work on your relationship with your parents, because even though
          they (or more specifically your dad) might not show it, they love you more than anything
          in this world.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you succeed in your career and in your life, and that your next relationships are
          more fruitful and peaceful. I hope you have taken this time to have a deep look into
          yourself and acknowledged the things you need to change to make yourself more trustworthy,
          a woman a man can count on.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm sorry I couldn't be that person, and I myself can only thank you for showing me my
          constant flaws that were there all along and were costing me my relationship and my
          sanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Make sure to show this to your kids or grandkids in your 60s or 70s so they know who one
          of the biggest loves of your life was, and to remind yourself of the good moments you
          lived while you were young. This page will (hopefully) be here forever and you can revisit
          it whenever you want.
        </p>

        <p>Make sure next time you never let things get to that point.</p>

        <p>I'll always care for you, as God is The Space Between Us.</p>
